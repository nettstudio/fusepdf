# Basic usage

For the most basic usage we assume you have a couple of PDF documents you want to merge into one.

You can add PDF documents in various ways, either by drag-and-drop or with the ``Open`` action in the toolbar, right-click and ``Add`` or in the ``File`` menu (``Ctrl+O``). You can select multiple documents with the open dialog, and of course drag-and-drop multiple documents.

![Screenshot of main interface with document added](https://github.com/nettstudio/fusepdf/raw/main/docs/fusepdf-screenshot-02.png "Screenshot of main interface with document added")

You can move documents up and down, and remove with the ``DEL`` key or right-click ``Remove``.

That's it, if you are satisfied click ``Save`` (or ``Ctrl+S``) and you are done. As default the generated PDF will open in your default PDF viewer.

# Excluding pages

Sometimes you may want to exclude some pages from a document.

Double-click the document or select the tab with the document you want to modify.

Enabled pages are marked as green. If you want to exclude a page just double-click it. You can also select all or none through the context menu (right-click).

# Issues

Some common issues users may experience.

## Missing Ghostscript

![Screenshot of missing Ghostscript](https://github.com/nettstudio/fusepdf/raw/main/docs/fusepdf-screenshot-08.png "Screenshot of missing Ghostscript")

If you see this dialog your installation is broken, or you are using a version of FusePDF shipped without Ghostscript. On Windows follow the instructions or download a FusePDF version with Ghostscript included. On macOS/Linux/BSD and others make sure Ghostscript (``gs``) is installed and available in path, check your package manager for more information.

For macOS [Richard Koch](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/) hosts Ghostscript binaries that will work with FusePDF. Else use [macports](https://ports.macports.org/port/ghostscript/) or [homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ghostscript) to install Ghostscript.

# Open Source

FusePDF targets Windows as it's primary platform, but since it's open source it can be built and run on most platforms available today. We check compatibility with macOS and Linux and rely on community feedback for more exotic platform. If Qt5 and Ghostscript works on your platform, FusePDF will too.

## Introduction

FusePDF requires Qt5 (Core/Gui/Widgets/Concurrent) to build, and Ghostscript (``gs``) available during runtime.

## Dependencies

Instructions for installing the needed dependencies on various platforms.

### Debian/Ubuntu (and compatible)

``sudo apt install ghostscript qt5-default qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev-tools``

### Fedora/CentOS/RHEL (and compatible)

``sudo yum install ghostscript qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-qttools``

### macports

``sudo port install ghostscript qt5-qtbase qt5-qttools``

### FreeBSD

``sudo pkg install ghostscript9-agpl-base qt5``

## Download

Download the latest (``main``) source code from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/nettstudio/fusepdf
cd fusepdf
git submodule update -i
```

Or download the latest stable tarball [release](https://github.com/nettstudio/fusepdf/releases/latest).

## Building

In the FusePDF source folder run the following commands:

```
mkdir build && cd build
qmake CONFIG+=release PREFIX=/usr .. && make
```
