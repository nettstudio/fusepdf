## Features

* Drag-and-drop any PDF document
* Preview input and output pages
* Exclude/Include pages
* Export to images and/or PDF
* Support PDF presets
* PDF compatibility up to version 1.7
* Change or add PDF meta data (properties)

# Usage

## Basic usage

For the most basic usage we assume you have a couple of PDF documents you want to merge into one.

You can add PDF documents in various ways, either by drag-and-drop or with the ``Open`` action in the toolbar or in the ``File`` menu (``Ctrl+O``). You can select multiple documents with the open dialog, and of course drag-and-drop multiple documents.

That's it, now click ``Save`` (or ``Ctrl+S``) and you are done.

## Issues

Some common issues users may experience.

### Missing Ghostscript

![Screenshot of missing Ghostscript](https://github.com/nettstudio/fusepdf/raw/main/docs/fusepdf-screenshot-08.png "Screenshot of missing Ghostscript")

If you see this dialog your installation is broken, or you are using a version of FusePDF shipped without Ghostscript. On Windows follow the instructions or download a FusePDF version with Ghostscript included. On macOS/Linux/BSD and others make sure Ghostscript (``gs``) is installed and available in path, check your package manager for more information.

For macOS [Richard Koch](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/) hosts Ghostscript binaries that will work with FusePDF. Else use [macports](https://ports.macports.org/port/ghostscript/) or [homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ghostscript) to install Ghostscript.
